- User-defined functions (UDFs) in PySpark
- DataFrame optimization and Catalyst Optimizer

### Week 4: PySpark SQL and DataFrame API
- Introduction to PySpark SQL

- Handling missing data in DataFrames
- DataFrame visualization using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Month 2: Intermediate PySpark Concepts

### Week 5: Data Manipulation and Exploration with PySpark
- Handling various data types and schemas
- Working with dates and timestamps
- Aggregations, pivots, and cross-tabulations
- PySpark DataFrame functions: `withColumn()`, `drop()`, `alias()`, `distinct()`
- Advanced Joins (Left, Right, Inner, Outer, Semi, Anti joins)

### Week 6: Advanced PySpark DataFrame and SQL Functions
- Built-in functions: `lit()`, `when()`, `otherwise()`, `regexp_replace()`
- Complex data types: Arrays, Maps, Structs
- Working with nested JSON files
- Advanced window functions: `lead()`, `lag()`, `ntile()`, `percent_rank()`
- Performance tuning techniques: broadcast join, `repartition()`, `coalesce()`

### Week 7: PySpark Machine Learning with MLlib
- Introduction to Spark MLlib and its architecture
- Feature engineering and preprocessing: `StringIndexer`, `VectorAssembler`, `StandardScaler`
- Building machine learning models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
- Evaluating models: `RegressionEvaluator`, `BinaryClassificationEvaluator`
- Hyperparameter tuning using `CrossValidator` and `ParamGridBuilder`

### Week 8: Clustering and Recommendation Systems in PySpark
